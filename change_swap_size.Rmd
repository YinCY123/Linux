# How to Increase Swap Size on Ubuntu Linux
The recent release of Ubuntu use swap file instead of the traditional swap partition. The swap file is simply a file under the root which is used as swap to share the burden on the RAM.

The biggest advantage of using a swap file is that you can easily resize it. That's not always the case when you use a dedicated swap partition. 

## Increase swap size on ubuntu
```
# to see if you have a swap file 
swapon --show


# to resize it you have to turn the swap off
sudo swapoff /swapfile


# use the fallocate to change the size of the swap file
sudo fallocate -l 50G /swapfile

# enable the swap file
sudo swapon /swapfile

# check the effects
free -m
```
